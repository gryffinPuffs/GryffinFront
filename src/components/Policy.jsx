        AccioBooks reserves the right to remove Merchandise at any time in its
        sole discretion but shall have no obligation to do so. In the case where
        controversial Merchandise is not removed, providing additional context
        and information may be helpful to Users and to support an informed
        public conversation about the topic. Therefore, AccioBooks reserves the
        right to label Merchandise that contains disputed information as such
        and/or provide links to external, credible sources containing additional
        information related to the controversy. The cost to ship Merchandise
        that a Customer purchases through the Website is calculated on a “per
        order,” “per item,” or “per pound” basis and is based on the shipping
        option the Customer selects at the time of purchase. AccioBooks will
        ship the Merchandise to the address designated by the Customer so long
        as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions
        contained on the Website. All transactions are made pursuant to a
        shipping contract and, as a result, risk of loss and title for the
        Merchandise passes to the Customer upon delivery of the Merchandise to
        the carrier.

          If a Customer is not satisfied with their purchase from AccioBooks or
          any Platform Seller, the Customer may return such Merchandise for a
          refund of the purchase price of the Merchandise plus any applicable
          taxes to the Customer’s original form of payment so long as the
          Customer notifies AccioBooks within fourteen (14) days of receipt of
          such Merchandise. All Merchandise must be returned in its original
          condition; shrink-wrapped Merchandise must be unopened. Shipping fees
          will not be refunded. The packing slip in each Customer shipment has
          specific instructions for returns, but is not a prepaid shipping
          label. Customers will be required to arrange for and cover the costs
          of shipping returned Merchandise.
