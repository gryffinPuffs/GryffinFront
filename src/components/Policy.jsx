          AccioBooks.org reserves the right to remove Merchandise at any time in
          its sole discretion but shall have no obligation to do so. In the case
          where controversial Merchandise is not removed, providing additional
          context and information may be helpful to Users and to support an
          informed public conversation about the topic. Therefore,
          AccioBooks.org reserves the right to label Merchandise that contains
          disputed information as such and/or provide links to external,
          credible sources containing additional information related to the
          controversy.

        <b>Order Fulfillment</b>
        <br></br>
      </h3>
      The cost to ship Merchandise that a Customer purchases through the Website
      is calculated on a “per order,” “per item,” or “per pound” basis and is
      based on the shipping option the Customer selects at the time of purchase.
      AccioBooksorg will ship the Merchandise to the address designated by the
      Customer so long as such address is complete and complies with the
      shipping restrictions contained on the Website. All transactions are made
      pursuant to a shipping contract and, as a result, risk of loss and title
      for the Merchandise passes to the Customer upon delivery of the
      Merchandise to the carrier.

        <b>Return Policy</b>
        <br></br>
      </h3>
      If a Customer is not satisfied with their purchase from AccioBooks.org or
      any Platform Seller, the Customer may return such Merchandise for a refund
      of the purchase price of the Merchandise plus any applicable taxes to the
      Customer’s original form of payment so long as the Customer notifies
      AccioBooks.org within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such Merchandise.
      All Merchandise must be returned in its original condition; shrink-wrapped
      Merchandise must be unopened. Shipping fees will not be refunded. The
      packing slip in each Customer shipment has specific instructions for
      returns, but is not a prepaid shipping label. Customers will be required
      to arrange for and cover the costs of shipping returned Merchandise.
